Held every five years, the competition would be hosted by each school in turn, the judges for the Tournament comprising the headmasters or headmistresses of the schools.',

Multiple attempts had been made to revive the Tournament, but none succeeded until the 1994â€“1995 school year, when it was held at Hogwarts Castle.',
                    'Despite a new set of rules imposed to prevent any more deaths, a champion nevertheless died at the end, though this only occurred due to the tournament being sabotaged.'
